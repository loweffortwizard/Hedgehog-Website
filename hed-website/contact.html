				<h2>Contact</h2>
				
				<p> Why is this such an important area to focus on? Why not just have contact information, like a phone number or email address? While providing the best ways to get in touch is an essential part of the contact page, there should be a little more thought put into it. No matter what industry or field you are involved with, an amazing contact page has the ability to entice visitors and convince them to either make a purchase or hire your services. </p>
				
				<p> Make Sure it is Functional: We know this is obvious, but take the time to double-check everything on the page. Having links that are broken or will not send properly is just bad for business. If the email or phone number links are not functional, how can people communicate with you? That kind of defeats the purpose of the contact page. </p>
				
				<p> It Should Look Great: Visuals are a big part of your website design. The contact page may not sound the most interesting, but do not neglect its appearance. If you have a poorly designed page, people will not be interested in establishing further relations. </p>
				
				<p> Well-Written Copy: Attract and maintain visitors with language that is action and value oriented; meaning it includes a call to action and how visitors will benefit from you or your brand. This will help you set up further communication. Furthermore, keep the page short and to the point. People do not want to spend a lot of time filling out forms. </p>

					<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
					<p>The hedgehog got its name because of its peculiar foraging habits. They root through hedges and other undergrowth in search of their favourite food - small creatures such as insects, worms, centipedes, snails, mice, frogs, and snakes. As it moves through the hedges it emits pig-like grunts thus, the name hedgehog.</p>

					<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
					<p>While hunting for food, they rely primarily upon their senses of hearing and smell because their eyesight is weak though their eyes are adapted for night-time vision.</p>
