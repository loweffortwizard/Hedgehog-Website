				<h2>Help Us Out!</h2>
				<p> Fortunately, we know that hedgehogs love gardens and we know what features they need to survive and thrive in suburbia. This is why Hedgehog Street was born. It's all about simple things everyone can do to help save our favourite wild animal (N.B. The Hedgehog Champion vote played a huge part in deciding this).  </p>

				<h2>Hedgehog Section</h2>
				
				<p> Hedgehogs need access to lots and lots of different gardens to survive, so this campaign is as much about getting people to cooperate as it is about gardening for wildlife. </p>
				
				<p> Wherever you live, the green space in your local area can be a vital refuge for hedgehogs. This website has everything you could possibly need to help them thrive. In an increasingly urbanised Britain, we choose to lose all that is complex and beautiful if we do not stand up for our wild animals and plants. </p>
				
				<p> There are some 15 species of hedgehog in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Hedgehogs have also been introduced into nontraditional ranges such as New Zealand. The hedgehog was named because of its peculiar foraging methods. These animals root through hedges and other undergrowth in search of the small creatures that compose the bulk of their diet insects, worms, centipedes, snails, mice, frogs, and snakes. As a hedgehog picks its way through the hedges it emits piglike grunts thus, the hedgehog. </p>
				
				<p> Some people consider hedgehogs useful pets because they prey on many common garden pests. While on the hunt, they rely upon their senses of hearing and smell because their eyesight is weak. </p>
