				<h2>About Us</h2>
				
				<p>First and foremost an About Us page has to get a point across. Everything else is completely useless unless the content and the layout is achieving a goal.  </p>
				
				<p>That goal is to tell the user who you are by showing them what you can do for them or have done for others. </p>
				
				<p>Some About Us pages spend the whole time talking about what it is that the company does and nothing about the staff members. Some do the opposite. Unless the page gives the information that you need based on the type of site you are on then it will not make the list. </p>
				
				<p>A good About Us page always needs to have some mention of past successes, achievements, social proof, etc. Giving concrete examples of why your site or blog is worth reading is extremely important for these pages. </p>
				
				<p>Some of the About Us pages I am about to show you will make you weep because they are so beautiful. Some not so much. But it is important to note that I have not included any pages on here purely because they look nice. </p>
				
				<p>The reason for this is that some About Us pages look amazing but have terrible content whilst others look terrible but grab your attention immediately. </p>

					<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
					<p>The hedgehog got its name because of its peculiar foraging habits. They root through hedges and other undergrowth in search of their favourite food - small creatures such as insects, worms, centipedes, snails, mice, frogs, and snakes. As it moves through the hedges it emits pig-like grunts thus, the name hedgehog.</p>

					<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
					<p>While hunting for food, they rely primarily upon their senses of hearing and smell because their eyesight is weak though their eyes are adapted for night-time vision.</p>
